Welcome to my final project for ITCS-3112!

This project is designed to be a finance tracker and manager for a business named SoftwareForNoobs.

This program could be tailored to make it fit other businesses but for simplicties sake I only made it with one example.

Inside the program you must login as an Owner or Project Manager and will have different permissions based on the type of user you are
logged in as.

The only functionality that this actually changes is that Project Managers cannot edit the salaries of employees, but they can still view them.

Here are some logins for users already created in the system.

Owner:
Username:amcoma0
Password:78910

Project Managers
Emily Johnson
Username: emily.johnson
Password: emilyTheBest

David Thompson
Username: david.thompson
Password: davidTheGreat

The data used by the program is held by text files that are read at the beginning of the driver and then written to at the end of the driver when the user is done entering input.
